Requirements:
Your application needs to handle a number of users
Each user has a profile
You application should have some extra data related to your user based on what you’re implementation goal is, for example: wishlist/shopping cart for E-Commerce site, player stats for a game, wins/losses for a game, posts for a blog/chat, etc
This data should follow CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
The site administrator(s) could potentially be the only ones with certain permissions such as delete, but your app should still support this functionality)
You’ll be using MySQL backend (provided by NJIT AFS)
Your SQL scripts should be stored on github
If using the init_db sample keep your structural changes under a folder called “sql” and keep any data changes or queries under “queries”
Your project will be hosted on your NJIT AFS site
